### experimenting with code one repo at a time.

I’m learning programming, computers, and the science behind technology
through practice, curiosity, and consistency.

I don’t have all the answers, and that’s part of the process.
This profile documents my learning through experimentation, mistakes,
and gradual understanding.

I’m fascinated by the field itself, by knowledge,
and by the way logic and creativity meet in computing.

> — Alan Turing

Just curiosity, continuous learning,
and the intention to build real understanding —
one repository at a time.
