# Hi, I’m Amanda! 
### experimenting with code one repo at a time.

I’m here learning about programming, computers, and the science behind technology.

I don’t have all the answers yet, and I don’t expect to.  
This profile exists during the process: while I learn, test, fail, and slowly understand how things work.

I’m fascinated by the field, by knowledge itself, and by the way logic and creativity meet within computing.

There’s no clear roadmap here.  
Just curiosity, continuous learning, and the desire to build understanding — one repository at a time.
